Zeta /ˈziːtə/ \[***noun***\]

1. the sixth letter of the Greek alphabet (**Ζ**, **ζ**), transliterated as ‘**z**’.†
2. an educational computer programming language.

***<center>ABSTRACT</center>***

**Zeta**, denoted by the Greek letter '**Z**', is—*purely*—an educational computer programming language, not unsuitable for non-educational use, merely philosophically ignorant, excluding interdisciplinary matters; thus, it is domain-specific in principle, albeit general-purpose in practice.
